        Dr. Brown is one of just six percent of U.S. dentists who have earned
        the prestigous Fellow of the Academy of General Dentistry designation.

            If your dentist is a Fellow or Master of the Academy of General
            Dentistry (FAGD or MAGD), they are the best of the best in the

            the latest techniques and best practices in dentistry. Your dentist
            practices these techniques in a classroom setting multiple times a
            year â€” not every dentist does this.
