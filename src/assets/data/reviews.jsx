      "Dr. Brown made me a total new set of dentures that attaches to mini implants. Now, I can eat sandwiches, grilled meats, BBQ ribs, steaks, and all kinds of hard foods. If you are having problems with your dentures, I would recommended Dr. Keith Brown to anyone.",

      "I had a dental emergency and Dr Brown was able to get me in to see him the next day and proscribed meds for me right away.  When I saw him the next day, he and his staff were very nice and professional.  The doctor did a great job dealing with my teeth. It was quick and relatively painless.  I have found a new dentist.  I highly recommend Dr Brown.",

      "This was my dentist back when I lived in Illinois and the staff was always pleasant and professional. They worked with me to help plan out my dental plan and have really helped me hold higher priority for my dental health. I will always hold Dr. Brown in the highest regards. I wouldn't have the pearly whites I have today without his help then. Thank you!! :)",

      "I had terrible tooth pain on a Saturday.  My regular dentist didn’t respond to my emergency call.  I found Doctor Brown’s website and called him.  He responded Saturday night, told me how to treat my pain, made me an appointment for Monday, and told me to call him back if things got worse. I saw him on Monday and had a root canal right away.  Yeah, I can eat solid food again! Bravo Doctor Brown!",

      "This office is a great place to go to take care of your teeth! Dr. Brown is very thorough and makes sure you are comfortable and even has music for you to listen to while he is working, which is a great distraction! Susan, his assistant, is also very friendly and they both made me feel at ease. 10/10! Would recommend!",

      "Thorough consultation for my long-standing problem undiagnosed by multiple dentists over the years. Mutual weighing of best use of my financial resources. Thorough direction of aftercare for long-standing abscess and faulty root canal. Thank you Dr Brown for your sensitive painless extraction. After novacaine wore off I was delayed in taking my prescribed painkillers and so I had residual aching in the area whether from the shots or the infection or the complications of my extraction I would not know but after taking the painkillers and a night s sleep the ache was gone never to return",

      "Dr. Brown is one of the best dentists I have been to and I wouldn't ever choose another dentist again based on how knowledgeable and experienced he is! One of the greatest things about his practice is that you can basically get everything you need done there and not have to be referred out to someone else. Also, the office staff is very friendly and they definitely make you feel welcomed and they will take great care of you!",

      "I travel from Atlanta Georgia to see Dr. Brown .. My daughter flies in from Winston Salem. I expect the highest quality. I do not want 'get me by care', 'redo' dentistry is not an option. I don't have insurance and am happy to pay for excellent care. I had a molar root canal by a specialist in South Carolina and they ruined the tooth and never told me ... 10 years of 'trouble', Dr. Brown found the problem showed me the photos and recommended the best solution. I had my bone graft and implant last February and drove out for each visit ... no pain, No worry...",

The staff, Susan, and Laura, were like my best pals, spurring me on to get thru what I'm convinced would have been a tremendous struggle anywhere else. My dentures ARE my real teeth, and i love them!

Not only did he fix multiple problems that had risen but he also helped set me up to have a comfortable and safe pregnancy.",

It's out of network, but Dr. Brown took time away from regular work hours to make sure I got pain medication prescribed and I've gotten at least 30 cavities and cracks fixed- I'm making up for a lot of dental absences. I've gone from looking like I might lose teeth to where they look really good.",
